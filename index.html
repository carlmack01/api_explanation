		<p><em>This activity was done in two parts.  The first looked at a randomly selected population of over 500 cities with specific data types such as precipitation, cloudiness, temperature, and so on.</em></p>
		<br>	
		<p><em>The second component included finding a suitable vacation spot by using various limiting filters. All of this was done using API calls and json reading.</em></p>
